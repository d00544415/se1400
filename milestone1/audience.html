<h3> <figcaption>Competicion vs US</figcaption></h3>
<p>we don't have direct competition because their is not store or business like us, products that we want to sell are different and also are very variable so because we are not selling just one product we have come and also he want to offer products by seasons ,this is not something very common that's why there are not web sites that can make direct competition </p>
<h3>similarities</h3>
<p>One of the similarities is that many of these products contain the same ingredients, but our products are made using our own recipe, and that makes a big difference.</p>
