        <p>
            We don't have direct competition because there is no store or business like us. The products that we want to
            sell are different and very diverse. We are not selling just one product — we also want to offer products by
            seasons. This is not very common, which is why there are no websites that can be considered direct
            competition.
        </p>

        <h3>Similarities</h3>
        <p>
            One of the similarities is that many of these products contain the same ingredients, but our products are
            made using our own recipe, and that makes a big difference.
